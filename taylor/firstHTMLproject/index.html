        <h1>My name is Taylor Hunt.</h1>
        <h2>My favorite color is <span class="favorite">green.</span></h2>
        <h3>I like to play raquet sports like tennis but I also like to play pickleball too. Sadly, none of my friends want to play with me. Racquetball is also a lot of fun.</h3>

        <p>I like to play video games. I really enjoy playing <b><i>Rocket League.</i></b></p>

        <pre>
            I like to 
            cook food
            and then 
            eat it.
        </pre>

        <p>BBQs are a fun place to eat food and talk to friends.
